 for n nodes the total different binary trees that can be formed is given as:
 t(n) = C(2n, n)/(n + 1) for unlabelled tree
 t(n) = C(2n, n) * n!/(n + 1) for labelled tree
 t(n) is called catalan number

 for h height of a binary tree, we get nodes(n) as
 minimum nodes = h+1
 maximum nodes = 2^(h+1) - 1

 for n node of a binary tree, we get height(h) as
 maximum height = n-1
 minimum height = log(n+1) - 1

 in binary tree, 
 deg(2) is external/non-leaf node
 deg(0) is internal/leaf node
 deg(0) = deg(2) + 1

 in strict binary tree
 when height is given
 minimum node = 2h + 1
 maximum node = 2^(h + 1) - 1

 when nodes is given
 maximum height = (n - 1)/2
 minimum height = log(n + 1) - 1

 in strict binary tree
 deg(0) = deg(2) + 1
